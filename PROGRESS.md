# Zine Social Media Platform - Progress Documentation

## 🎯 Project Overview
Building Zine - a creator-first social media platform with React + Vite + TypeScript + Supabase.

**Core Promise:** "Your work matters more than your follower count."

---

## ✅ Completed (Phase 1: Foundation)

**Status: FULLY WORKING ✅**
- Signup/Login functional
- Database schema deployed
- All security policies active
- Email verification working

### 1. Database Schema (Supabase)
All tables created with Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

#### Core Tables:
- **profiles**: User profiles with username, bio, avatar, privacy settings
  - Unique username constraint (3-20 chars, lowercase, alphanumeric + underscores)
  - Birthdate for age verification (13+ required)
  - Email verification tracking
  - Private/public profile toggle

- **posts**: User posts with captions and privacy
  - Privacy toggle (public/followers-only)
  - AI-generated content flag
  - View count tracking

- **post_images**: Carousel slides for posts
  - Multiple images per post (1-12)
  - Order index for sequencing
  - Per-slide captions (500 chars)
  - Template support (image-full, image-note, quote, side-by-side)
  - Thumbnail URLs for performance

- **follows**: User relationships
  - Prevents self-follows (constraint)
  - Bidirectional tracking

- **likes**: Post engagement
  - One like per user per post
  - Real-time count tracking

- **collections**: User-curated post collections
  - Public/private toggle
  - Name, description, cover image

- **collection_items**: Posts saved to collections
  - Junction table for many-to-many relationship

- **comments**: Post discussions
  - Nested under posts
  - Edit/delete own comments

- **notifications**: Activity tracking
  - Types: follow, like, comment, save
  - Read/unread status
  - Links to actors and posts

#### Security Tables:
- **reserved_usernames**: Prevents squatting on @admin, @zine, @help, etc.

#### Storage:
- **posts bucket**: Public storage for images
  - Anyone can view
  - Authenticated users can upload
  - Users can delete own images
  - Path structure: `/posts/{userId}/{timestamp}-{filename}`

#### Triggers:
- **Auto-create profile**: Automatically creates profile row when user signs up
- **Indexes**: Performance indexes on all frequently queried columns

#### Fixes Applied:
- ✅ Made `username` nullable (set after signup)
- ✅ Enabled RLS on `reserved_usernames` table
- ✅ Email verification configured in Supabase dashboard

---

### 2. Design System

#### Brand Colors:
- **Primary**: Deep Indigo `hsl(239, 66%, 51%)` - Serious, craft-focused
- **Accent**: Terracotta `hsl(14, 77%, 62%)` - Human, authentic
- **Background**: Clean white/gray palette
- **Text**: Deep charcoal for readability

#### Typography:
- **Font**: Inter (web-safe fallback to system fonts)
- **Hierarchy**: Clear heading scales (text-sm to text-6xl)
- **Weights**: 400-700 for proper emphasis

#### Components:
- All shadcn/ui components configured
- Custom color tokens in CSS variables
- Tailwind config extends with semantic colors
- Consistent border-radius and spacing

---

### 3. Authentication System

#### Supabase Auth Integration:
- **Email/password authentication**
- **Email verification required** before posting
- **Session management** with localStorage persistence
- **Auto token refresh** handled by Supabase client

#### Auth Context Provider:
- Centralized auth state management
- Provides `user`, `session`, `loading` states
- Real-time auth state updates with `onAuthStateChange`
- Proper initialization order (listener first, then check session)

#### Protected Routes:
- Route guard component
- Redirects to login if unauthenticated
- Loading states during auth checks

#### Forms:
- **Signup**: Username, email, password validation
  - Checks reserved usernames
  - Checks username availability
  - Client-side validation (pattern matching)
  - Creates profile automatically via trigger
  - Email redirect URL configured

- **Login**: Email/password with error handling
  - Clear error messages
  - Loading states
  - Redirect to feed on success
